# My Minimal Todo List

My take at a todo list. 

A minimalistic todo list web application made using React.

Currently, the application is client-side only, which means that the data is stored on the browser. However, I will add a Flask backend in the near future, so that data is persisted on the server.

## Updates
- November 2022: Resume frontend development
- August 2021: Flask backend is added
- July 2021: Basic todo functionality is implemented

## Current Features
- Adding/deleting todos

## Upcoming Features
- Light/dark theme

- Search bar to search todos
- Custom todo lists
- Landing page to introduce the application
- User authentication

## Tech Stack
- React for creating the UI
- Redux for managing state

## How to Run
After cloning or downloading the project, launch a terminal and run `npm start`. Open a web browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to use the todo list.
